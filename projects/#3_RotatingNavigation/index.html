          "Wes Anderson's mind must be an exciting place for a story idea to be
          born. It immediately becomes more than a series of events and is
          transformed into a world with its own rules, in which everything is
          driven by emotions and desires as convincing as they are magical.
          "Moonrise Kingdom" creates such a world and takes place on an island
          that might as well be ruled by Prospero. It's set in 1965, though it
          might as well be set at any time..." <br />
          "Anderson always fills his films with colors, never garish but usually
          definite and active. In "Moonrise Kingdom," the palette tends toward
          the green of new grass, and the Scout's khaki brown. Also the right
          amount of red. It is a comfortable canvas to look at, so pretty that
          it helps establish the feeling of magical realism. The approaching
          turmoil of adolescence is foretold, however, by an approaching
          hurricane that places the lives of the young explorers in danger.
          Their trek, their camp and the search for them under the mounting
          danger reminds me of the sort of serials I used to follow in Boy's
          Life magazine, although those regrettably were not co-ed."<br />

          "...The success of "Moonrise Kingdom" depends on its understated
          gravity. None of the actors ever play for laughs or put sardonic spins
          on their material. We don't feel they're kidding. Yes, we know these
          events are less than likely, and the film's entire world is
          fantastical. But what happens in a fantasy can be more involving than
          what happens in life, and thank goodness for that."
